# Event Finder

## Purpose
An easy to use application that helps users find events based on search criteria and display the route from a user input address to the event location.

## Description
This application uses the Bulma CSS framework to help style the contents of the page. We then used JavsScript and jQuery to create dynamic elements on the page. This application allows a user to enter search criteria for events on a form. This criteria is entered into the Ticketmaster API to find events. These events are placed on dynamic button elements which can be selected to show more event information. The user can then enter any address or location they desire into the modal which will then display the route to the event.
